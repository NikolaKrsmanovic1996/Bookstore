# Bookstore


Bookstore or Comicbook store web application here.
-------------------------------------------------
I used thymeleaf, Mysql, SpringToolSuite(3.9 version)
In order to run this app you must got installed Mysql into your computer and Install spring tool suite or Eclipse but you need to find jar files for Spring

After you downloaded Mysql and Eclipse or SpringToolSuite first you need to run bookstore for creating tables in mysql then restart.
